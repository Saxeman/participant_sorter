Welcome to the documentation for this program I wrote
1. Usage
        Run this with python terminal. Command Line arguments are as follows:
                [filepath/main.py][filepath/input1.csv][etc.]
        This program does support multiple input files as well as duplicate handling.
        Make sure to rename the Courses to the SISID number they are associated with or writing of data will not work
2. Debugging
        Most of this code is run with python's built in csv data type. There shouldnt be any big issues but if you find
        anything, email me at ajsaxe@umich.edu
