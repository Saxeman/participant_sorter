Welcome to the documentation for this software I wrote
1. Usage
        This script will take in two inputs, enrollment.csv and participants.csv. It will then create Canvas import documents so that those in the participants tab will be exported into their respective CSV's (which are sorted by SISID in the Course folder). Formatting for the two CSV's should be as follows:
        Enrollment.csv: First Name,Middle Name,Last Name,Email Address,Courses Taken
        Participants.csv: uniqname,UMID,GivenName,MiddleName,Surname,PersonalEmail
        
        Run this with python terminal. Command Line arguments are as follows:
                [filepath/main.py][filepath/enrollment.csv][filepath/participants.csv][etc.]
        This program does support multiple input files as well as duplicate handling.
        Make sure to rename the Courses CSV's to the SISID number they are associated with or writing of data will not work
2. Debugging
        Most of this code is run with python's built in csv data type. There shouldn't be any big issues but if you find anything, email me at ajsaxe@umich.edu
